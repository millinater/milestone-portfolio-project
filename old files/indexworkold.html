            <h1>Outside of designing and coding this cool website, here are some other examples of my work.</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="full-width">
            <div class="third-width" id="first-block">
              <img src="img/my-logo-v7.png" id="logo" alt="Amelia Mae Design Logo"/>
                <p> During my classes with Skillcrush, we were tasked to design a logo and business card for our web design and development company.  I created the logo using Adobe InDesign and the business card using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
                  <img src="img/my-business-card.png" id="card" alt="Amelia Mae Design Business card"/>
            </div>
            <div class="third-width" id="second-block">
              <img src="img/siri.png" id="siri" alt="Renaissance Apple Watch"/>
                <p> In my role as a Group Sales Manager for the Renaissance Montgomery Hotel & Spa at the Convention Center, I was tasked to make several marketing and promotion publications.  This particular project was an email footer to inform clients of the Group Promotion for an Apple Watch.  I created this image and used Canva to design the layout, font pairings, and flow, as well as the written copy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="third-width" id="third-block">
              <a download="pick-3.pdf" href="/img/pick-3.pdf" title="Pick Three Promotion">
                <img alt="Pick Three Promotion" id="pick" src="img/pick-3.png"/>
              </a>
                <p> These two examples are for seperate group promotions that I designed and created using Microsoft Office Publisher.  These PDFs are interactive and contain links to several areas of the hotel's website for meeting information and contact forms to submit a Request for Proposal.  The images were altered using Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Publisher.</p>
                  <a download="kickback.pdf" href="/img/kickback.pdf" title="Kick Back Promotion">
                    <img alt="Kick Back Promotion" id="kick" src="img/kick-back.png"/>
                  </a>
            </div>
            <div class="half-width" id="fourth-block">
              <img src="img/handout.png" id="handout" alt="Renaissance Handout"/>
              <a download="inline.ppt" href="/img/inline.ppt" title="INLINE Broadcasting Presentation">
                  <img alt="INLINE" id="inline" src="img/inline.png"/>
                </a>
                <p> The Renaissance Montgomery Hotel & Spa at the Convention Center document to the left, was created for a tradeshow event.  The idea was to stand out from hundreds of other hotels and venues.  The magazine table of contents layout was a creative way to showcase important hotel facts to meeting planners. This document was designed and created using Microsoft Publisher. <br>
                  The document on the right is a presentation that I created for a mock group sales presentation.  We were given information about our madeup company and their meeting needs.  The goal was to give a creative, personalized, and influential sales presentation.  The company was in broadcasting, so I created a presentation based off of a news broadcast format- to include topic handoffs, graphics, and breaking news.</p>
